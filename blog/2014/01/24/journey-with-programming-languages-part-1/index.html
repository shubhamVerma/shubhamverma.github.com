<div class="entry-content"><h3>The School</h3>

<p>I first saw a PC at a relative’s house, on which I just played <strong>NES</strong> ( the Nintendo Entertainment System ) like games.</p>

<p>My first PC was Intel Pentium III, 800 MHz CPU, 256 MB RAM, but it was good enough to play the original <strong>GTA Vice City</strong>.</p>

<p>My first encounter with programming was with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">MS Logo</a> as part of my school curriculum. I can’t exactly remember which grade I was in at that time. It used simple commands to draw lines, shapes and patterns. It was an awesome first time experience. I used to try various commands trying to build spider-web like patterns.</p>

<p>Then I got introduced to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html">HTML</a>, the language of Web, as it was also a part of my school curriculum. It gave me a sense of working with something that’s really being used heavily out there. It was fun to make awfully looking colorful pages and link them with each other.</p>

<p>In my final grade, we had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>. It felt a lot more related to programming than HTML (I think everybody agrees with that). With that came stuff like <strong>Object Oriented Programming</strong>, classes, object etc. I was able to understand the basics of programming like variables, types, conditionals etc. but was not pretty clear with the whole Object-Oriented stuff and why things were supposed to be done in that way. I learned the definitions but failed to grasp the true meaning, may be due to my small age and lack of abstract thinking.</p>

<p>That was the time I decided that this is the thing I am going to do for making a living. It gave me a sense of creativity and it was a great feeling to see my code work (for the first time). It gave me a sense of happiness. I felt emotionally attached to code. After completing my matriculation I decided to go for a Diploma in Computer Science instead of conventional higher secondary education, as Maths, Physics and Chemistry failed to excite me much, and there was no point in continuing them ( which I regretted later as my interest aroused in <strong>Game Development</strong> which heavily relied on Maths and Physics)</p>

<p>This was end of my schooling and then I continued my education by joining Diploma in Computer Science.</p>

<p>To be continued</p>
