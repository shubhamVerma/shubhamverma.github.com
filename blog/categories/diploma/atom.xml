    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Diploma - B. Tech - Current</h3>

<p>Been a long time since the last post.</p>

<p>So, the next stop in my journey was the <strong>Web land</strong>. There was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. This is where I learned the <strong>principle of separating the actual content from its presentation and behaviour</strong>. Now this principle is very general, hence is not only applicable to the Web land, but also to <em>(insert your favorite development platform here)</em> which basically includes some kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Interface">User Interface</a>. It can also be considered as a special case of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concerns</a> principle. I didn&rsquo;t touch much on the <strong>JavaScript</strong> as I was unware of its real power!</p>

<p>Then I got interested in <strong>Game Development</strong> (O yeah!). I tried many approaches including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegro_%28software%29">Allegro</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker:_Studio">Game Maker</a> etc. and finally ended up using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_BASIC">Blitz BASIC</a>. Its just a derivative of the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> along with some specific features for game development such as <strong>graphics, input</strong> and <strong>audio handling</strong> etc. The syntax was easy and the approach was pretty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development">RAD</a>. I developed a simple <strong>vertical scrolling shooter</strong> with help of my awesome younger brother (who is way more creative than me!). We together did some game UI elements with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop">Photoshop</a>.</p>

<p>I designed the <strong>ship</strong> for the game myself with the <a href="http://www.aseprite.org/">Allegro Sprite Editor</a>. It was a 32x32 <strong>bmp</strong>. For the rest of the sprites and game music, I searched the web. <strong>The game lagged as the number of asteroids increased, due to my inefficient algorithm, as it was my first attempt on building a complete game</strong>. Somehow I managed to finish it. It was a fun experience.</p>

<p>The next language was the cousin of the previous one, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">Visual Basic</a>. I didn&rsquo;t like it much and was not convinced by the whole <strong>drag and drop idea for developing user-interfaces</strong>. It might have been a boon in early times, but for me, <strong>it seemed less programmatic</strong>. I just did for the sake of my curriculum.</p>

<p>As time went by, my diploma finished and I came to <strong>Chennai</strong> for the B. Tech. in Computer Science.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29">Python</a> seemed to be very popular those days on the web. I looked up for some examples and decided to give it a shot. <strong>I loved it!</strong> It was <strong>fun</strong>, <strong>easy to learn</strong> and <strong>understand</strong>, had <strong>cool in-built data structures</strong>. The syntax was plain and simple, just like English. I found it very useful for <strong>quick tasks</strong> and <strong>programming competitions</strong>. I used it for solving problems from websites like <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, <a href="http://codeeval.com">CodeEval</a>, <a href="www.spoj.pl">SPOJ</a> etc. My solutions to some of the problems from Project Euler and CodeEval can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/shubhamVerma">Github</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Though I loved Python, I couldn&rsquo;t decided whether I wanted to pursue my careeer in it</strong>. I didn&rsquo;t pursue the advanced concepts but had learnt enough for trivial problem solving.</p>

<p>My current favorite is JavaScript. It is the language of Web, and Web is the Future. So JavaScript is the language of future! To quote <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>, the great JavaScript wizard:</p>

<blockquote><p>The World&rsquo;s Most Misunderstood Programming Language Has Become the World&rsquo;s Most Popular Programming Language</p></blockquote>

<p>and yes, he is referring to <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/popular.html">JavaScript</a>. I am very <strong>comfortable with the syntax</strong> as coming from a <strong>C</strong> background and I appreciate its <strong>dynamic</strong> and <strong>functional</strong> nature as I was already exposed to those concepts through <strong>Python</strong>. I am impressed by the recent developments in the JavaScript ecosystem, especially <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, and the rise of <a href="http://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/nanil/archive/2013/04/01/exploring-javascript-mv-frameworks-part-1-hello-backbonejs.aspx">front-end MV* frameworks</a>. Though <strong>it has its <a href="http://darkhelmet.github.io/javascript-the-bad-parts/#/title">quirks</a></strong>, I have planned to take it very seriously and pursue it to be a <strong>full stack JavaScript developer</strong>. I am also looking forward to learn some <strong>un-conventional but exciting!</strong> technologies like <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> and the list goes on.</p>

<p>By now, you might have concluded that <strong>I am a language geek!</strong> For people out there planning to go on a similar adventure, I would like to say that, <strong>try to focus on problem solving rather than getting lost in the syntax details</strong>. The syntax will come naturally once you learn the basics. I wish you good luck for  your programmatic journey. Just don&rsquo;t forget to have fun! :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The Diploma</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_language">C</a> was my first friend in diploma. It was a fresh beginning from the basics of programming. The books I referred at that time were <strong>Let Us C</strong>, <strong>How To Program - C Edition</strong>. C is an important language when it comes to both programming and understanding how low level stuff, like memory, works, as most of the things has to be taken care by the programmer himself. I was scared by <strong>pointers</strong> initially, but gradually overcame by trial and error method (what most programmers often do). I used Turbo C, but switched to <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">Dev-C++</a>. On the way I also tried <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code Blocks</a>.</p>

<p>In the beginning, it gets bit difficult to decide which is the <strong>appropriate tool for the job</strong>, but the ultimate choice is what suits you the best.</p>

<p>I learned about <strong>random numbers</strong> and created fun games for number guessing etc. I am glad that I learnt C, as it helped me in building a <strong>good foundation and a sound programming perspective</strong>.</p>

<p>Then I came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>. This time I read about OOPs properly. It felt very similar to C and later I realized that it was a superset of C. The new stuff was <strong>classes</strong>, <strong>objects</strong>, <strong>templates</strong> etc. I didn&rsquo;t look much into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library">STL</a> (which I should have done!), but I liked the concept of templates, as they were great for <strong>abstraction</strong> and <strong>generalization</strong> of code. The books that I referred to for C++ were <strong>C++ for Artists</strong>, <strong>How To Program - C++ Edition</strong>, and <strong>Thinking in C++</strong>.</p>

<p>I just love abstraction. <strong>Learning to think abstractly also leads to a better life</strong> (as it is all about ignoring unnecessary stuff).</p>

<p>Next one was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>. It is actually more of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a> rather than a programming language. And that means you only need to specify <strong>what you want instead of how you want</strong>. The <strong>query engine</strong> handles all that complex stuff. It is easy to learn but it also got complicated with stuff like <strong>database specific implementations</strong> of SQL, <strong>sub-queries</strong> etc.</p>

<p>SQL is relevant for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDBMS">RDBMS</a>. I was also introduced to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_relationship">Entity-Relationship model</a> along with that. It is a nice and effective tool for <strong>high level design of the database</strong>, again providing <strong>abstraction</strong>. For some hands-on SQL, I preferred to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite">SQLite</a>, as it didn&rsquo;t need a server and used simple files as the database. For executing queries and connecting to the database, I used <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Servers/Database-Utils/Database-NET.shtml">Database .NET</a>. Its a freeware and fine for practicing.</p>
